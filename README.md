# 2019-2020 Homework Projects
<h4>Some homework projects from my first year of university study.</h4>

<h1>Fall 2019 - Intro to OOP - <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/students/Undergraduate-Studies/courses/CSE114">Class Description</a></h1>

 <h1>Spring 2020 - Data Structures - <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/students/Undergraduate-Studies/courses/CSE214">Class Description</a></h1>
<h3>General Ledger Manager (214-1)</h3>
<p>As an accountant for Jack's general bank account, a general ledger was created to help him keep track of his financial transactions. The general ledger is simply a list where an individual can record and manage their transactions.</p>
<h3>Station Interface (214-2)</h3>
<p>Scheduling trains that use the same railway is a tough, yet important, problem to solve when it comes to transportation. One train being even several minutes off can lead to a butterfly effect of congestion, delays, and many frustrated passengers. It can also be hazardous if two trains are mistakenly scheduled to arrive on the same track at the same time. Our job is to implement an interface to interact with all trains in the same station in the form of a linked list. A Station will contain a list of Tracks, and each Track will contain a list of Trains. Linked lists are efficient in these types of situations because the list can be easily modified without changing the whole structure of the existing list.</p>
<h3>Detailed Calculator (214-3)</h3>
<p>You have been hired as a Junior Software Developer to help design their newest line of calculators. You may be thinking this will just be some ordinary calculator, but you quickly realize at the first production meeting that Wolfy Tech only makes the highest quality of products, and your calculator will be much more advanced than originally thought. Not only will the calculator have to calculate numbers, but it will also need to show these calculations in pre-fix / post-fix notation and show the answer in binary and hexadecimal, in addition to some other proprietary features. After some research and preliminary write-ups and brainstorming, you realize that the best way to go about this will be to create your own Stack class.</p>
<h3>Diner Simulator (214-4)</h3>
<p>In this project, we will be simulating the serving of customers at different diners. The objective of the simulation is to mirror a real-life analysis on how different variables affect trends in restaurant efficiency and profit. Efficiency is represented in broad terms by the amount of time it takes to serve a customer and the number of customers lost due to an inability to provide good service. We will be simulating multiple diners at the same time. The Queue data structure will be utilized in this project.</p>

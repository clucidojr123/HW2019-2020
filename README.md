# 2019-2020 Homework Projects
<h4>Some homework projects from my first year of university study. All projects are done using Java.</h4>

<h1>Fall 2019 - Intro to OOP - <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/students/Undergraduate-Studies/courses/CSE114">Class Description</a></h1>
<h3>Connect Four</h3>
<p>This is a text-based representation of the popular Connect Four game.
 The first player to place four consecutive chips of their color in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

 <h1>Spring 2020 - Data Structures - <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/students/Undergraduate-Studies/courses/CSE214">Class Description</a></h1>
<h3>General Ledger Manager (214-1)</h3>
<p>As an accountant for Jack's general bank account, a general ledger was created to help him keep track of his financial transactions. The general ledger is simply a list where an individual can record and manage their transactions.</p>
<h3>Station Interface (214-2)</h3>
<p>Scheduling trains that use the same railway is a tough, yet important, problem to solve when it comes to transportation. One train being even several minutes off can lead to a butterfly effect of congestion, delays, and many frustrated passengers. It can also be hazardous if two trains are mistakenly scheduled to arrive on the same track at the same time. Our job is to implement an interface to interact with all trains in the same station in the form of a linked list. A Station will contain a list of Tracks, and each Track will contain a list of Trains. Linked lists are efficient in these types of situations because the list can be easily modified without changing the whole structure of the existing list.</p>
<h3>Detailed Calculator (214-3)</h3>
<p>You have been hired as a Junior Software Developer to help design their newest line of calculators. You may be thinking this will just be some ordinary calculator, but you quickly realize at the first production meeting that Wolfy Tech only makes the highest quality of products, and your calculator will be much more advanced than originally thought. Not only will the calculator have to calculate numbers, but it will also need to show these calculations in pre-fix / post-fix notation and show the answer in binary and hexadecimal, in addition to some other proprietary features. After some research and preliminary write-ups and brainstorming, you realize that the best way to go about this will be to create your own Stack class.</p>
<h3>Diner Simulator (214-4)</h3>
<p>In this project, we will be simulating the serving of customers at different diners. The objective of the simulation is to mirror a real-life analysis on how different variables affect trends in restaurant efficiency and profit. Efficiency is represented in broad terms by the amount of time it takes to serve a customer and the number of customers lost due to an inability to provide good service. We will be simulating multiple diners at the same time. The Queue data structure will be utilized in this project.</p>
<h3>Create Your Own Adventure (214-5)</h3>
<p>In this assignment, we will be implementing a Choose-Your-Own Adventure type game. Using a tree structure, you can link together various scenes to tell a story. The program is able to allow a user to play the game created as well. </p>
<h3>Grocery Store Manager (214-6)</h3>
<p>In this assignment, we are tasked to write an inventory management system for a grocery store, where you will be using hash tables to store information about each item in the store's inventory.
   
   The employees will use this software to track the inventory of items in their grocery store.
    They should be able to add items either by loading text files 
    (which contain JSON information for each item to add to the inventory) or by 
   manually inputting information. 
   At the end of each business day, they will be able to process 
   all sales information (stored in a file) and update the inventory levels of all items, 
   generating orders for items that need replenishment. </p>
<h3>Organ Transplant Inventory Manager (214-7)</h3>
<p>We have been tasked with the creation of a system which will be responsible for matching organ donors with potential transplant recipients. In order to achieve high success rates of surgeries, there are certain parameters which must be considered before matching patients. This includes making sure that a patient can receive a transplant from an organ donor based on both the patient's and donor's blood types. If these blood types are not compatible, the patient cannot receive the transplant, and no match between the two is made. We will store the information about donors and recipients as a graph. Each node will represent either a donor or a recipient, with the neighbors of that node being those who have been determined to be a match for the needed transplant. We will also be able to display the information to the user, in a variety of sorted formats (by blood type, by ID, by number of matches, by organ).</p>
